Car Parking Slot System
Overview
The Car Parking Slot System is a streamlined parking management solution that allows users to request and reserve a parking slot, with an approval step by the parking facility owner. Once a userâ€™s request is approved, the system allocates a slot and charges a parking fee. This setup ensures better control over space management and verified slot allocation.

Features
Slot Request and Approval: Users request a slot by providing car details, which the owner reviews and approves. Only upon approval is a slot allocated.
Car Details Collection: During the request, users provide car information (model, license plate, color) to verify vehicle details.
Parking Fee: After approval, users are prompted to pay a parking fee, calculated based on the duration of the reservation.
Real-time Availability Check: Users can view available slots before making a request.
Slot Cancellation: Users can cancel their approved booking; any fee refund follows cancellation terms.
